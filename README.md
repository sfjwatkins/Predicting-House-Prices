Predicting House Prices Using Advanced Regression Techniques

In this project, we were aiming to build a model that could accurately predict house sale prices using the 'Ames house data set': this contains 79 feature variables for almost 3000 houses that were sold in this area of Iowa between 2006-2010. Following detailed exploration and cleaning of the data, we engineered and transformed the features and used pycaret to select the models we would use. In this selection, the CatBoost Regressor performed best, so we used this to train a baseline model. Our k-fold validation evaluated this model as achieving a RMSE of 1.1259 (so an error of just over a dollar!): to put this in context, the mean sales price was $180,921, so our model was predicting with a high degree of accuracy. We used this model to make predictions on the test set (as part of a Kaggle competition) and achieved a RMSE of 1.1325. We then optimzed the parameters and used a bagging emsemble to attempt even greated accuracy. This ensemble model returned a RMSE 1.1289 for the test set, which was an improvement on the baseline. We concluded that we had trained an effective model that could be used for house price predictions for similar datasets; and made suggestions for further improvements.
